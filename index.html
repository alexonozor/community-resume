        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Nigeria</p>

        <hr>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>I am continuously in awe of technology and people interaction. How do we break up complex problems into
            understandable and sizeable bits, solve daily challenges with technology, build better communities and
            inspire people to stand on the
            shoulder of giants? This enormous curiosity has led me to serve as a Builder of Communities, Professional
            Trainer, Prolific Writer, Technology Advocate and Developer of intuitive, interesting and impactful
            technology solutions.</p>

        <p>I am energetic, lover of Rachel(my wife) and a firm believer of inspiring greatness around people.</p>


        <h2><b>Reason for applying</b></h2>

        <p>I struggled a lot during my initial days of learning to become a developer. Honestly, the books and videos
            were there and easy to get from the internet but there was really no developer community in Nigeria.

            Over time, I have discovered that there is nothing greater than having community efforts drive the building
            of products and provide easy entry for talented people to join the limited pool of developers and
            technologists currently available.</p>

        <p>I am very passionate about programming, building products (open-source and proprietary software) specifically
            with web, mobile technologies and mentoring passionate, talented minds in becoming world-class developers
            and technology leaders.</p>

        <p>I want to raise more developers that are passionate about the community. Developers that will go on to become
            speakers, advocates, authors and thought leaders. I want to inspire developers to be more than just code
            monkeys, developers that will mentor and be mentored. All these are geared towards having a very vibrant
            developer community.</p>

        <p>As a Google Developer Expert, I'll have more resources and tools to be able to reach out to fellows across
            remote parts of Africa and also around the world, providing them the opportunity to change the world by
            introducing them to web technologies and mentoring them alongside.</p>

        <p>As a Google Developer Expert, I'll be a part of a community of talented developer experts and Googlers which
            provides me an incredible opportunity to grow in leaps and bounds as a programmer, trainer, author and
            developer evangelist.</p>
